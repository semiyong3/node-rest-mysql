# node-rest-mysql

This is a boilerplate for using Node.js with Express to host a RESTful API for a MySQL/MariaDB Database.

Supports Collection and Specific Item requests over GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (PATCH not currently implemented)

## Resources

### Developed using a couple resources:

1. Express (http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html)
2. MySQL for Node (https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql)
3. RESTAPI Tutorial (http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)
4. Router in Express 4 (https://scotch.io/tutorials/learn-to-use-the-new-router-in-expressjs-4)
5. Build a RESTful API Using Node and Express 4 (https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4)
6. Node 404 (http://stackoverflow.com/a/33310600)
7. RESTful Best Practices (http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#advanced-queries)

### Consider Using

1. Test a Node RESTful API with Mocha and Chai (https://scotch.io/tutorials/test-a-node-restful-api-with-mocha-and-chai)
2. Express CORS (https://github.com/expressjs/cors)

## Installation

1. `npm install`

2. create a `credentials.js` file in the root of the repo

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
       host     : 'localhost',
       user     : 'me',
       password : 'secret',
       database : 'my_db'
   }
   ```

3. OR pass in MYSQL_HOST, etc as evnironment variables (eg. from Heroku's Config Vars)

4. Your database needs to be setup with a table called `panos`

5. Use Postman or your browser to make requests to the api, at `/api/panoramas/` and `/api/panoramas/:id`

## TODO

1. Use whitelisted Origin header, instead of "*"
2. Fix and Improve Route List Generation - `/api/`
3. Support for Filtering, Limiting, Sorting Results
4. Architecture decision and Routes for how we handle Panorama Categories
5. Authentication?
6. Implement things from [Consider Using](#consider-using) Section
